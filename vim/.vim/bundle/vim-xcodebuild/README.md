# xcodebuild.vim

Plugin for building and testing Xcode projects from within Vim


## Installation

Recommended installation with [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle):

```vim
Plugin 'gfontenot/vim-xcodebuild'
```

## Usage

`xcodebuild.vim` is a thin wrapper around `xcodebuild` itself. It dynamically
finds the project in the current working directory (with support for
workspaces as well) and builds the first scheme it finds.

 - `:XBuild` will build the project
 - `:XTest` will test the project

### `xcpretty` support

[`xcpretty`] is a gem for improving the output of xcodebuild. By default, if you
have it installed, `xcodebuild.vim` will pipe all `xcodebuild` output through
`xcpretty` with the `--color` flag.

For customization options, see the [included help doc][help] (`:help
xcodebuild` from within Vim).

### Async builds

By default, `xcodebuild.vim` will take over the current terminal session to
build and display the build/test log. However, with long build times, this
might not be ideal. To help with this, `xcodebuild.vim` allows you to
customize the runner by setting `g:xcodebuild_run_command`. This variable
should be a template string, where `{cmd}` will be replaced by the
`xcodebuild` command.

```vim
let g:xcodebuild_run_command = 'VtrSendCommandToRunner! {cmd}'
```

This is useful for using `xcodebuild.vim` with other plugins such as
[`vim-tmux-runner`] and [`vim-dispatch`].
